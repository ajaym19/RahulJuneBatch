	/*
	 * Abstraction:
	 * abstract? idea, which is not completely clear
	 * 
	 * we are trying to hide the implementation/code 
	 * 
	 * Can be achieved in 2 ways
	 * 1. Interface
	 * 
	 * In Interface, we use implements keyword
	 * 
	 * It is the responsibility of the class implementing the interface to implement the abstract methods
	 * One class can implement multiple Interfaces
	 * 
	 * In Interface, all the methods are by default abstract
	 * 
	 * we can achieve 100% abstraction
	 * 
	 * Selenium: there are some people who are developing Selenium
	 * 
	 * Interface: Webdriver >> define some compulsory methods
	 * 
	 * Chrome: they supported chrome browser
	 * 
	 * Mozilla
	 * 
	 * IE
	 * 
	 * Opera
	 * 
	 * 10+
	 * 
	 * 2. Abstract Class
	 * any method without a body should have abstract keyword
	 * any class with an abstract method should be declared as abstract
	 * 
	 * it can contain abstract and non abstract methods also
	 * 
	 * we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
	 * 
	 *
